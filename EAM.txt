Uninformed Search Strategies
	An uninformed search algorithm is given no clue about how close a state is to the goal(s).
these include:
	Breadth-first search
	Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm or uniform-cost search
	Depth-limited search
	Bidirectional search
	Depth-first search
	Heuristic Functions

Still building the workspace index, response may be less accurate.

Certainly! Here's an overview of the folder structure and its contents:

### Root Directory
- **LICENSE**: This file typically contains the licensing information for the project.
- **pom.xml**: This is the Maven Project Object Model file. It contains configuration details used by Maven to build the project, including dependencies, plugins, and build configurations.
- **sports.owl**: This is likely an OWL (Web Ontology Language) file, which contains ontology data used by the application.

### 

ufsc

 Directory
This directory contains the Java source files for the project. The package structure follows the typical Java convention of organizing code by domain (edu.ufsc).

- **Awnser.java**: This file likely defines the 

Awnser

 class, which is used in the 

Main class.
- **

CommentaryExtractor.java

**: This file likely defines the `CommentaryExtractor` class, which is used to extract commentary from the ontology.
- **

Main.java

**: This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the 

main

 method and various helper methods to interact with the ontology and handle questions and answers.
- **

Question.java

**: This file likely defines the `Question` class, which represents questions used in the application.

### Key Points in 

Main.java


- **Imports**: The file imports various classes from the OWL API and other Java libraries.
- **Class Variables**: 
  - 

scanner

: A 

Scanner

 object for reading input.
  -

- **Class Variables**: 
  - 

scanner

: A 

Scanner

 object for reading input.
  - 

commentaryExtractor

: An instance of `CommentaryExtractor`.
  - 

maybeAnwsers

: A list of `Question` objects.
- **Main Method**: 
  - Initializes the 

Scanner

 and 

OWLOntologyManager

.
  - Loads the ontology from the 

sports.owl

 file.
  - Extracts individuals and builds questions from the ontology.
  - Contains a loop to handle user interaction and process questions.

### Maven Configuration (`pom.xml`)
- **Project Information**: Defines the group ID, artifact ID, and version of the project.
- **Build Configuration**: Specifies the source directory and the Maven Compiler Plugin configuration to use Java 1.8.
- **Dependencies**: Includes dependencies like the OWL API.

This structure indicates that the project is a Java application that uses the OWL API to interact with an ontology defined in 

sports.owl

. The 

Main

 class serves as the entry point, orchestrating the loading of the ontology, extracting information, and handling user interactions.
